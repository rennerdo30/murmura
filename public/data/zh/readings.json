    "translation": "Existentialism, as one of the most influential philosophical movements of the twentieth century, profoundly reveals the existential predicament of modern man. Sartre proposed the thesis \"existence precedes essence,\" believing that humans first exist, then define themselves through their own choices. This viewpoint grants humans freedom while also bringing heavy responsibility. Heidegger focused on the mode of existence of \"Dasein,\" pointing out that people often fall into the mundane routines of daily life, forgetting to question existence itself. In contemporary society, material life becomes increasingly abundant while the spiritual world becomes increasingly impoverished. People are swept up by consumerism, losing themselves in the pursuit of fame and fortune. Existentialism reminds us: life has no preset script, and everyone must take responsibility for their own existence. Facing nothingness, we can choose to escape, or we can bravely take on the mission of creating meaning. As Camus said, even if we recognize the absurdity of life, we can still, like Sisyphus, find our own happiness in the process of pushing the rock up the mountain.",

    "translation": "The ancients said: 'In books there are golden houses, in books there are beauties like jade.' Although this saying smacks of utilitarianism, it reveals the importance of reading. However, modern people read mostly for fame and fortune, rarely for the pursuit of knowledge itself. The way of reading lies in proper method. First, one must clarify the purpose and know what one needs; second, select books wisely, preferring quality over quantity; third, reading has depth and shallowness, skimming and intensive reading should be distinguished; fourth, apply what you learn, connecting theory with practice. Ancient scholars studied for themselves, modern scholars study for others. Those who study for themselves internalize all learning in their hearts; those who study for others merely decorate their facades. If one reads only to show off elegance, one loses the original meaning. True readers should be like Tao Yuanming who said 'love reading, not seeking thorough understanding,' finding resonance between the lines, drawing nourishment from the wisdom of ancient sages. Only thus can one achieve 'a belly full of poetry and books, naturally exuding refinement,' reaching the state of self-cultivation and character nurturing.",
